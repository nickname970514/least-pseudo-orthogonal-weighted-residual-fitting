# least-pseudo-orthogonal-weighted-residual-fitting
Fitting the variables x and y while taking into account their upper and lower errors, without averaging the upper and lower errors. This is necessary when there is a significant difference between the upper and lower errors.
The code also provides error scatter and intrinsic scatter of the data. Details can be found in the paper: (will be updated soon)
Additional Requirement:  
When using this code in academic work, you must cite the following paper:  (will be updated soon)
